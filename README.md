Hello! I'm Daniel. I'm a frontend web developer.  I take pride in helping my clients build websites and web applications that bring sales, generate leads, is responsive, well optimized, accessible to all, and provides a great user experience. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. 

Beyond front-end coding, I’m also passionate about writing and sharing my thoughts on copywriting, and web optimization on my blog and other forums. I really value the ability to not only perform web development work but also help others improve their craft because I’ve gained so much from others sharing their skills and knowledge.
